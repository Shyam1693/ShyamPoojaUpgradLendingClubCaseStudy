# Lending Club Case Study

Lending loans to applicants deemed as high-risk constitutes the most significant contributor to financial loss within the lending industry, a phenomenon commonly referred to as credit loss. Credit loss represents the monetary value that lenders incur when borrowers either fail to repay their loans or abscond with the owed funds.

The primary objective at hand is to develop a robust capability for identifying these high-risk loan applicants effectively. Achieving this goal would lead to a reduction in the issuance of loans to such individuals, consequently mitigating the overall credit loss. The crux of this case study lies in employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to discern the critical factors, often referred to as driver variables, that strongly correlate with loan defaults.

By successfully identifying these key driver variables, the company can harness this valuable knowledge to enhance its portfolio management and risk assessment strategies. This newfound understanding will enable more informed decision-making processes, ultimately fostering a more secure and sustainable lending environment.
